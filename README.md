Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease Using Artificial Intelligence

Project Description

This work summarizes our research on the early detection of Parkinson's disease using artificial intelligence models. Our study analyzed MRI scans of the substantia nigra region in the brain to develop a model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning, aiming to explore the possibility of early diagnosis.

Data Structure

For this research, we utilized three data sources:

MRI scans of healthy individuals

MRI scans of diagnosed Parkinson's patients

MRI scans of individuals with early symptoms, who were later diagnosed with Parkinson's disease several years after the initial scans

Methodology

The task was divided into two main phases:

Training models to differentiate between MRI scans of healthy individuals and Parkinsonâ€™s patients.

Applying Transfer Learning to refine the models using scans of individuals with early symptoms, enhancing accuracy in early diagnosis.

Results and Conclusions

We achieved impressive results in identifying the disease at its early stages. Detailed findings can be reviewed in the attached research files.
